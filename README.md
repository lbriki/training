# DevOps Project

## Overview

This project focuses on containerizing and deploying three main components:

1. **Frontend Container** - A web interface for the application.
2. **Backend Container** - The core logic and API layer.
3. **QR Container** - A Python-based service for generating QR codes.

## Project Stages

1. **Local Deployment**:
   - Use **Ansible** to automate environment setup.
   - Deploy the containers using **Docker Compose**.

2. **Orchestration with Kubernetes**:
   - Migrate the containerized services to a **Kubernetes cluster**.
   - Implement scaling, load balancing, and service discovery.

## Technologies Used

- **Docker**: For containerizing services.
- **Ansible**: For automating deployment tasks.
- **Docker Compose**: For managing local multi-container environments.
- **Jenkins**: For the CI/CD pipeline with multiple stages
- **Kubernetes**: For container orchestration in production.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated builds and deployments.
- Integrate monitoring and logging for better observability.
- Explore multi-cloud support for scalable deployments.
